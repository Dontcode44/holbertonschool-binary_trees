# Binary trees! ðŸŒ³

<p>A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Binary Tree node contains the following parts.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Data</li>
    <li>Pointer to left child</li>
    <li>Pointer to right child</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways. Following are the generally used ways for traversing trees.</p>

<p>Depth First Traversals:&nbsp;<br>(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3&nbsp;<br>(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3&nbsp;<br>(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1<br>Breadth-First or Level Order Traversal: 1 2 3 4 5&nbsp;<br>Please see <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/level-order-tree-traversal/">this&nbsp;</a>post for Breadth-First Traversal.&nbsp;</p>
